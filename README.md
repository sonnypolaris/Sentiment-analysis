# Sentiment-analysis
Sentiment analysis using Snowflake Snowpark python and Thoughtspot

  Sentiment analysis, a part of natural language processing (NLP), digs into feelings and thoughts expressed in text. It helps figure out if the text is positive, negative, or somewhere in between. With so much text online—like reviews and social media—sentiment analysis is like a detective tool for understanding what people really feel. It's not just about reading words; it's about using computers to understand tons of text all at once.

  Sentiment analysis is useful for businesses. It helps them learn what customers like or don't like. For example, it can tell if people are excited about a new product or if they're not happy with a service. This helps companies make smart choices. But figuring out feelings in text isn't easy. Sometimes, people write in funny ways or use words that mean something else. Sentiment analysis is like a puzzle where computers try to fit together the pieces of what people say to understand how they really feel.
